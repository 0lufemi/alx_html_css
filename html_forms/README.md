# HTML Forms

## 0. Simple Contact Form
Create an HTML form for a basic contact form with the following requirements:
* Include fields for the userâ€™s ```name```, ```email address```, and ```message```.
* Apply appropriate HTML5 validation attributes to ensure the ```name``` and email fields are required and that the email field accepts a valid email format.
* Use a ```<textarea>``` element for the message field to allow for a long description and not limit it to just one line.
* Add a submit button to submit the form.
